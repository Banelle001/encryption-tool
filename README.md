This is one of The Cyber security tasks which i was given.The purpose of sharing is to save it for later use and also those who will see it might use it


This Python script allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text messages. Encryption is an essential part of protecting sensitive information, whether you are storing it or transmitting it over a network. This project uses a simple encryption algorithm (specify which encryption technique you're using, e.g., Caesar Cipher, AES, RSA) to convert plaintext into ciphertext, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties.

The tool can be used for personal use, educational purposes, or as a base to develop more advanced encryption software.

Features
Text Encryption: Encrypt plaintext into unreadable ciphertext using (insert algorithm here).
Text Decryption: Decrypt the encrypted message back into the original readable form.
Customizable Keys (if applicable): Allows users to specify their own encryption keys for better security.
Cross-platform: The script works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux platforms.
